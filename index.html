          <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
          <div class="half-width" id="left_about">
            <p>I&#39;ve recently graduated from <a href="http://www.montclair.edu/">Montclair State University </a> but my education is only just beginning. I live right outside the <em class="red">Big <span>A</span>pple</em> in Fort Lee, New Jersey. I feel fortunate to find myself close to the center of America's second biggest tech hub outside of Silcon Valley.</p><br>
            <p><br>But my journey into tech started about a year ago, during my time as a Program Assistant for the Coccia Institute at <em class="red">MSU</em>. One of my duties was to completely revamp our resepctive website where had the chance to dabble with their archaic CMS (<em>they've since switched over to Word Press</em>). I received some basic tech training and HTML exposure but it wasn't enough to satiate my hunger for web development. I was fascinated with how creatively I could express myself with knowing so little. A couple of conversations with peers in web development later, I found myself scowering the web for free online resources. I was hooked by how accessible the training and tutorials were, so I made the decision to build my own site and sign up for <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses">The Odin Project</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> to quench my desire for web development.</p><br>
            <p><br>That passion to learn and dive deeper into the great unknown that is technology opened a door to a virtual world that could never be shut. Learning how to build my first website was just the beginning, the tip of the proverbial web-berg. I found something that gave me the creativity & challenge that I was looking for in my work.</p>

            <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
            <p>Quality over quantity here. I will always strive to follow best practices to ensure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible. Clean code is happy code.</p>

            <h3>Elegant CSS</h3>
            <p>I can sometimes be a perfectionist, even to the last pixel. That's why I try to write CSS that is easy to read and build on. I'm always doing research online to stay up to date on how to keep my CSS lean, precise and elegant.</p>

            <h3>Life-time Learner</h3>
            <p>My passion for coding flourished <em>after</em> I finished college. Whether in my current job as a coding instructor for children at <a href="http://www.codeadvantage.org/">CodeAdvantage</a> or studying at home, I'm always searching for ways to hone my craft. </p>
