            <p>I&#39;m Dariell Vasquez, a self-taught web developer hoping to make a big impact on our tomorrow. I recently graduated from <a href="http://www.montclair.edu/">Montclair State University </a> with a BA in Italian but my education continued after I walked out the doors of University Hall. Currently, I work remotely as a Google Ads Quality Rater and an on-site Lead Programming Instructor for kids throughout northern New Jersey. I&#39;m humbled to live right outside the <em class="red">Big Apple</em>, America&#39;s second biggest tech hub outside of Silicon Valley.</p><br>
            <p><br>If you finished the first paragraph wondering how Italian fits into tech, well it doesn&#39;t. Not directly at least. My journey into tech started about a year ago, during my time as the Program Assistant for the Coccia Institute at MSU(<em>a position I would not have landed if I was a non-Italian major</em>). Whether you say fate, chance or luck, this position gave me the opportunity to completely revamp our section of the university&#39;s website. I published and edited content on their CMS, Terminal 4 (<em>they&#39;ve since switched over to Wordpress</em>). I received some basic tech training and HTML exposure but it wasn&#39;t enough to satiate my hunger for web development. I was fascinated with how creatively I could express myself, even though I knew so little. Sadly, I already applied for graduation so I couldn&#39;t pick up the second major of computer science. After a couple of conversations with peers in tech, I began searching the web for free online resources. I was hooked by how accessible the training and tutorials were, so I decided to build my own site from scratch and sign up for
              <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses">The Odin Project</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> to quench my desire for web development.</p><br>
            <p><br>That passion to learn and dive deeper opened the door to a virtual world that could never be shut. I found something that gave me the creative outlet & continuous challenge that I was always searching for. Once I learned how to build my first website, I was already sizing up my next big opponent, Javascript. I hit the tip of the metaphorical web-berg, ready to see what laid beneath. </p>

            <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
            <p>Quality over quantity here. I will always strive to follow best practices to make sure that the content I put out is easy to read, easy to collaborate on, trouble-shoot and accessible. Clean code is happy code.</p>

            <h3>Elegant CSS</h3>
            <p>I can sometimes be a perfectionist, even to the last pixel. That&#39;s why I try to write CSS that is easy to read and build on. I&#39;m always doing research online on how to keep my CSS a lean, clean, elegant machine.</p>

            <p>My passion for coding flourished <em>after</em> I finished college. Whether in my current job as a coding instructor for children at <a href="http://www.codeadvantage.org/">CodeAdvantage</a> or studying at home, I&#39;m always searching for ways to hone my craft.</p>
